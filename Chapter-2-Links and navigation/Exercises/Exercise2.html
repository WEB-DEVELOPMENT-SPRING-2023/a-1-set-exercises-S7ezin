<p>
    Wealthy trader and serial killer David Robey blackmails and kidnaps cleaner Callum Aldrich. DCI John Luther is assigned to the case and promises Callum's mother, Corinne, he will find her son. Concerned about his involvement, Robey digs up dirt on the various illegal acts Luther has committed as a police officer, resulting in him being fired, prosecuted and imprisoned.[a]

Years later, Robey coaxes Corrine and the parents of other victims to a house where he burns their children's corpses. She visits Luther in prison, admonishing him for not finding her son's killer. Robey sends a recording of him murdering Callum to Luther in prison via a radio frequency. Luther informs DCI Odette Raine, the new head of Serious and Serial Crime, of the broadcast.
 He liaises with prison guards and former associate McCabe to break him out of prison. Raine brings in retired DSU Martin Schenk as a consultant. 
 Luther traces Robey to Piccadilly Circus, where Raine deploys armed police SCO19. The two confront him there, but some people he has blackmailed cause a distraction by killing themselves jumping from buildings and crashing cars. Robey escapes into the London Underground after fighting Luther and murdering an armed policeman.

Robey kidnaps Raine's daughter, Anya. Raine meets with Luther and reluctantly agrees to work with him. They visit Robey's ex-wife Georgette, discovering he owns property abroad.
 DS Archie Woodward, Raine's subordinate, is blackmailed by Robey into killing Georgette but is intercepted by Schenk (who was sent by Luther to protect Georgette). Archie commits suicide. Luther and Raine travel to Robey's mansion in rural Norway, where they discover he tortures kidnapped victims to death on a livestream called "The Red Bunker" for his followers. 
 The two are overpowered, and Robey tries to force them to hurt each other to save Anya. Luther reveals Georgette told the police the location and they are en route. After a brutal fight, the three are able to escape the bunker, and Luther chases Robey into a frozen lake, where Robey drowns. Luther is rescued by police divers and Schenk. Recovering from his injuries back in London he is approached by Cranfield,
  a senior official with MI5, who, it is implied, offers him a job in lieu of going back to prison

        <h3>Elba's Audition for james bond</h3>
        In many James Bond films, 007 ends up battling the villain in an underground fortress, a deep sea fortress, an overground fortress, 
        or, at the very least, a faraway fortress. And we never really know how he got there or why the villain chose that as his headquarters but there we are,
         disbelief suspended, rooting for our hero. The malevolent villain in his malevolent fortress surrounded by malevolent underlings. But - and this is important - we expected that from Bond. After all,
          the ENTIRE WORLD was at stake. And what better to bring down the world than a fortress?</li>

        <h3>A disappointing return for Idris Elba's detective</h3>
        Luther: The Fallen Sun is a Netflix film that serves as a continuation of the BBC series Luther, starring Idris Elba as John Luther, a brilliant but troubled detective who breaks out of prison to hunt down a serial killer.
         While fans of the show might be excited to see Elba reprise his iconic role, they will likely be let down by this film's lackluster plot, weak villain and wasted potential.

The film suffers from a lack of originality and suspense, as it recycles many elements from previous seasons of Luther, such as Luther's relationship with Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson),
 his former partner Justin Ripley (Warren Brown) and his new ally Angela Rose (Cynthia Erivo). The serial killer, played by Andy Serkis, is a cartoonish and unconvincing antagonist who has a vague motive and an unrealistic plan.
  The film also fails to explore Luther's character development or moral dilemmas, instead relying on clich√©s and contrivances.

The only saving grace of this film is Idris Elba's performance, which is still charismatic and compelling despite the weak material. He manages to convey Luther's inner turmoil and determination with subtlety and intensity.
 However, even he cannot elevate this film above its mediocrity. Luther: The Fallen Sun is a disappointing return for one of TV's most complex and captivating detectives.</li>
